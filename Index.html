                <h3>Chesong Rongpi</h3>
                <p class="chesong" ><h4>Rich:</h4>Riches can at times extend beyond financial gain. 
                    The deceased cannot be brought back, no matter how much money you have.
                    Even if I had nothing in my pocket, if my parents and grandparents is still with me, 
                    I would be richer than the billionaire who does not have them..</br><h4>Success:</h4>In my opinion, there are two types of successful people. 
                    The first are those who have built up a large amount of wealth and have enough money to solve the majority of their problems.
                    Second, there are those who have built up wealth but are not as selfish as to use it solely for their own benefit. The person who has used his wealth to educate children,
                    feed the poor, and treat the disabled is more successful. 
                    Using wealth for yourself is fine because it is your hard earned money, but using wealth to help others is even better. </p>

                    if I get it, is success for me. I don't want success for myself;
                    I want it for my mother and father because they don't have a lot of support from their families and I want to give my mother anything she wants.
                    I want to prove to my family that I can succeed in the future . I want to live a healthy life, especially mentally.</p>

                <p class="ruben" ><h4>Rich:</h4>For me 
                    Like if you want to (not need to) buy something
                    You don't have second thoughts on that 
                    Like I can use this money on something I need rather than wasting on what I want.
                    You got the money,you buy it simple...
                    And also there is levels of rich of course 
                    Depends on how expensive the thing you can buy it easily without second thoughts.
                    For example-
                    Some people can buy phones and change it every month or so......
                    And some people can buy cars whenever they feel....
                    .</br><h4>Success:</h4>For most people it's getting job and to earn enough for their family so they can live happily.
                    For a businessman's son,
                    His success will be to be a great businessman like his father or to take on his father's business and make it grow even more
                    Something like that.
                    So success varies from person to person....</p>
